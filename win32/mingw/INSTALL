
To install and use SDL:

    1a. If you are compiling SDL applications natively using MSYS 1.0,
        you can install the SDL development files by typing "make mingw"

        When building SDL applications that are built with the standard
        UNIX configure method, you may need to copy the SDL.dll file to
        the directory containing the configure script before configure
        will detect the SDL installation.

    1b. If you are cross-compiling from Linux to Win32, and you have your
        cross-compiler installed /usr/local/cross-tools as described in:
            http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt
        you can install the SDL development files by typing "make cross"

    1c. If you are compiling SDL applications natively using Cygwin,
        you need to download and install the SDL library from source:
            http://www.libsdl.org/download.php
        This binary package does not include the Cygwin sdl-config

    2.  Look at the example programs in ./test, and check out the HTML
        documentation in ./docs to see how to use the SDL library.

    3.  Join the SDL developer mailing list by sending E-mail to
    	sdl-request@libsdl.org
        and put "subscribe" in the subject of the message.

        Or alternatively you can use the web interface:
            http://www.libsdl.org/mailing-list.php

That's it!
